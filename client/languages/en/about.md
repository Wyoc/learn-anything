# About Learn Anything
Learn Anything is the platform for knowledge discovery that helps you understand any
topic through the **most efficient paths**, as voted by the community. Each topic
has a mind map with nodes to other subtopics, external links and resources.

# Keep the project going
This project is built by the community, for the community and in our goals to
make the most efficient paths and the best user experience possible in exploring the
mind maps and finding the resources you need, we can only rely on donations made
by our users to sustain this project.

There are **no advertisements** and **no sponsored content** and that would be against
our vision of making the best and most optimal learning tracks for learning any topic.


We created a **[Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/learnanything)** where you can
support our work. Any donation that you make to this project is incredibly valuable
to keep this project going. We also have some awesome rewards that come with your support.
