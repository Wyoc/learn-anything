This is the main code-base that powers [learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz).

If you want to know more about what we're trying to solve, our plans for the
future, how to improve the maps, and more you can check the [wiki](https://github.com/learn-anything/maps/wiki).

<h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>

These instructions will allow you to set up your own instance of Learn Anything
to develop with.


<h2 align="center">Dependencies </h2>

Elasticsearch is needed for fetching maps and suggestions on the website. On
Linux you can download and run it with the following commands.

    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.5.2.tar.gz
    tar -zxf elasticsearch-5.5.2.tar.gz
    ./elasticsearch-5.5.2/bin/elasticsearch


<h2 align="center">Running </h2>

Once you have Elasticsearch up and running you can start your local instance of
Learn Anything with the commands below.

    git clone https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything
    cd learn-anything
    git checkout contrib
    npm run setup
    npm start

And then connect to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The first time it may take a while, since all maps will be added to elasticsearch.
After that only `npm start` will be needed.


<h1 align="center">Testing </h1>

To run automated tests you can use either `npm test` or `npm run test:watch`.
For now the tests are covering only reducers, action creators, and components.


<h1 align="center">API </h1>

Our API is still work in progress, as there will be more endpoints coming in the
future, but for now here's a list of all endpoints.

Note: the full url for any endpoint is `[url]/api/[endpoint]`, for instance if
you're developing locally to get a random map you'd use `http://localhost:3000/api/maps`.

| Endpoint                                | Method | Parameters | Description                     |
|-----------------------------------------|:------:|:----------:|---------------------------------|
| [/maps](#get-maps)                      | GET    | q          | get suggestions or a random map |
| [/maps/[id]](#get-mapsid)               | GET    | -          | get map by ID                   |
| [/maps/path/to/map](#get-mapspathtomap) | GET    | -          | get map by path                 |

#### GET /maps
Return a list of suggestions to complete the string in the **q** parameter.
Each suggestion is in the form of:

```json
{
  "key": "markup languages",
  "id": "1507",
  "nodesCount": 3
}
```

**key** is the search tag for the map, **id** is the ID to retrieve it, and
**nodesCount** is the number of nodes present on that map.

If **q** is not specified a list with one random suggestion will be returned,
otherwise a maximum of 10 relevant suggestions are returned.

#### GET /maps/[id]
Get a specific map by ID. Maps have the following format:

```json
{
  "title": "learn anything - programming - markup languages",
  "tag": "",
  "nodes": [],
  "connections": [],
  "key": "markup languages"
}
```

- **title** is the path to a map
- **tag** is a custom tag for searching the map
- **key** is the same as *tag* if *tag* is specified, otherwise it's the last topic on *title*
- **nodes** a list of the nodes contained on the map
- **connections** a list of the connections between the nodes

#### GET /maps/path/to/map
Get a specific map from its path. The format is the same as the one above.
